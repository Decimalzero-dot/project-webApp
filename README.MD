 ## 🚀 FREELANCE Platform
This is a robust web application built with Django, designed to connect clients and freelancers. It provides functionalities for user authentication, profile management, and potentially project listings.

 ## 🌟 Features
 - User Authentication: Secure signup and login for both Client and Freelancer roles.

 - Freelancer Profile Management: Dedicated views for freelancers to update their professional details (skills, bio, rates, etc.).

 - Role-Based Access: Protected views ensuring only authenticated users or specific roles (e.g., @login_required on profile_update_view) can access certain pages.

 - Database Integration: PostgreSQL or SQLite support for persistent data storage.
